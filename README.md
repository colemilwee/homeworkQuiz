# homeworkQuiz
in this assassinment i made a quiz using html css and javascript
first you make a layout in html with id class for the javascript 
after you get your html setup you can use the javascript to locate it by use getElementById
but first in javascript you need to setup your variables event listners and functions
for the first function i rendered the question by calling on the innerhtml this is useful cause now we can call on function for questions when we need it
for starting the quiz i made it a event listener on click and hiding everything but quiz and calling on the timer function
the timer fuction will start when you start quiz from 160 seconds to 0 you'll lose 20 seconds everytime you answer a question wrong and if it hits 0 the quiz ends
once the quiz ends you'll be taken to the highscore you can view it or add your own after the quiz
